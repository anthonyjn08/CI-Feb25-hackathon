## Judging Criteria
### Innovation/Creativity (is the app unique in comparison to others alrady out there?)
- We believe that our app is unique as it includes all kinds of couple. If you're married and looking for a date night or simply looking for a friend to walk your dog with, you can find it at PROJECT TBC.
### UI/UX (is the app intuitive, visually appealing and easy to navigate?)
- 
### Functionality (does the app function as intended?)
- 
### Social impact (does the app address critical issues like inclusivity, safety or accessibility?)
- Here at PROJECT TBC, it doesn't matter who are you or who you love, you're welcome here. With a moderation system amdeasy to navigate filters including LGBTQA+ and neurodiversity, we want PROJECT TBC to be a safe space for everyone.

## Introduction

### Problem Statement

## UX
### User stories
- As a user, when I go on the website it should be clear what the website is about and its purpose, so that that I know whether to I want to view the website or not.
- As a user, I should be able to register for an account, so I am able to sign in and book events that I want to go to.
- As a user, I should be able to log in to the app so I am able to register and book for events to go to.
- As a user, I should be able to view a range of events in different categories on the website so I know which area of the website to visit.
- As a user, I should be able to search for events via a filter, so I can view events most suitable for me.
- As a user, events I have booked should be added to my profile, so I can see events that I have already booked.
- As a user, I expect the app to be responsive on a range of devices, so I am able to view the app on differeent devices.
- As an admin, I should be able to create, read, edit, and delete events so I can keep the platform updated with the most relevant events.
